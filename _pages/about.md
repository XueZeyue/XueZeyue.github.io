Hello, Iâ€™m Zeyue Xue, a researcher with a passion for building Generative AI products and platforms. I am currently an AI advisor at Midjourney (China), optimizing the Chinese version of Midjourney. Besides, I am also a PhD student at HKU. Previously, I spent two years at SenseTime Research (working on training large vision models), and used to be a research assistant at NUS (working on large-batch optimization).

My last representative work includes [SenseMirage](https://miaohua.sensetime.com/zh-CN/), a large-scale image generator introduced in [RAPHAEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18295), which has garnered million-level users within just three months of its public release.

My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and deep generative models. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to email me.
