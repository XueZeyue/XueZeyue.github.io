Hello, I’m Zeyue Xue, a researcher with a passion for building Generative AI products and platforms. I am currently a researcher at Xiaochuan (Midjourney, China). My last representative work includes [SenseMirage](https://miaohua.sensetime.com/zh-CN/picture-selection), a large-scale image generator introduced in [RAPHAEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18295), which has garnered million-level users within just three months of its public release.

My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and deep generative models. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to email me.
