Hello, I'm Zeyue Xue (薛泽岳), a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of The University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Ping Luo and co-advised by Prof. Wenping Wang (ACM Fellow). My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and Generative AI. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to email me.

My representative work includes [SenseMirage](https://miaohua.sensetime.com/en), a large-scale image generator introduced in [RAPHAEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18295) and prominently featured by [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/cn) website.

<font color='red'> I am actively searching for a summer research intern position in the United States for 2024. If you are interested, please feel free to email me. </font>
