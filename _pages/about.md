Hello, I'm Zeyue Xue, a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of The University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Ping Luo and co-advised by Prof. Wenping Wang (ACM Fellow). 

My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and AIGC foundation models. My paper on training Faster R-CNN in a few minutes has garnered significant coverage in many famous Chinese media. Besides, I serve as a core researcher and developer in Sensetime's Basemodel team, **where I'm responsible for pretraining and optimizing AIGC foundation models.**
